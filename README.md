# PACT

Provider Agnostic Configuration Tooling

# Overview

The goal of this project is to collate build and configuration scripts that aid in continuous integration and deployment
for open source use that can be ran anywhere through Docker.

# Motive

A concern I have recently become familiar with is the need for provider agnostic tools that allow companies and individuals
the ability to build, test and deploy code in the same fashion across different CI instances.

At it's core CI is a simple concept. Automating scripts that developers or system administrators would typically run
manually on their computers, by running it on someone else's computer. Coupled with the philosophy that development
practices should also be simple to follow, this project aims to reduce the time taken to set up automation pipelines,
while allowing users to run modules locally with ease.

# Goals

Once nominal time is invested into learning the PACT ecosystem, users should be able to benefit from the following properties:

- Projects can be set up to run in a cloud build environment with as much ease as possible.
- Modules utilised in automated environments should be easily ran on local machines.
- Appropriate levels of logging with informative messages will be included to remove guesswork from runtime errors.
- Additional functionality and providers can be supported easily by extending the current well-documented framework.
